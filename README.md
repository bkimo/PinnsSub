# **Physic Informed Neural Network**

Repository to reproduce the experiments in the papers :

   - Estimates on the generalization error of Physics Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) for approximating PDEs
   - Estimates on the generalization error of Physics Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) for approximating PDEs II: A class of inverse problem
   
The code is part of a bigger project that is under ongoing work. Therefore, there are commented lines of code that might confuse the reader.   
## **Dependencies**

Dependecies are contained in the file requirement.txt and can be easily installed by typing in the terminal:

` pip install -r requirements.txt `
